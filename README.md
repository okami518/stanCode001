# stanCode_001
These assignments are practice projects from stanCode, focusing on Python syntax, nested structures, variable assignment and reassignment, string methods, and basic image pixel manipulation.

## Assignment_2  
This assignment practices indentation differences, loops, nested structures, and conditional statements, along with concepts like variable reassignment and computing statistics.
- Problem 1 – `quadratic_solver.py`
- Problem 2 – `hailstone.py`
- Problem 3 – `weather_master.py`
- Problem 4 – `prime_checker.py`

The following are optional problems.
- Extension 1 - `factorial.py`
- Extension 2 - `number_checker.py`
- Extension 3 - `triangular_checker.py`
- Extension 4 - `narcissistic_checker.py`

## Assignment_3  
This assignment practiced nested loops, string methods, conditional statements, random number generation(hangman), and simple comparison algorithms(similarity).
- Problem 1 – `rocket.py`
- Problem 2 – `complement.py`
- Problem 3 – `string_score.py`
- Problem 4 – `caesar.py`
- Problem 5 - `hangman.py`。

The following are optional problems.
- Extension 1 - `similarity.py`
- Extension 2 - `name_sq.py`

## Assignment_4  
This assignment practice image processing, nested loops, and pixel manipulation.
- Problem 1 – `fire.py`
- Problem 2 – `mirror_lake.py`

## Environment
- Python 3.7
- IDE: PyCharm (recommended for running and debugging)

## How to Run
1. Open the project in PyCharm.
2. Make sure the Python interpreter is set to **Python 3.7**.
3. Run the desired Python file (e.g., `quadratic_solver.py`) from the IDE.
