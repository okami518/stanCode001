# stanCode_001
These assignments are practice projects from stanCode, focusing on Python syntax, nested structures, variable assignment and reassignment, string methods, and some basic image pixel manipulation.

## Assignment_2
- Problem 1 – `quadratic_solver.py` - Solve a quadratic equation using basic Python syntax and math operations.
- Problem 2 – `hailstone.py` - Hailstone uses while loops and basic arithmetic operations to simulate the Hailstone sequence.
- Problem 3 – `weather_master.py`
- Problem 4 – `prime_checker.py`
- Extension 1 - `factorial.py`
- Extension 2 - `number_checker.py`
- Extension 3 - `triangular_checker.py`
- Extension 4 - `narcissistic_checker.py`

## Assignment_3
- Problem 1 – `rocket.py`
- Problem 2 – `complement.py`
- Problem 3 – `string_score.py`
- Problem 4 – `caesar.py`
- Problem 5 - `hangman.py`
- Extension 1 - `similarity.py`
- Extension 2 - `name_sq.py`
- Extension 3 - `triangular_checker.py`
- Extension 4 - `narcissistic_checker.py`

## Assignment_4
- Problem 1 – `fire.py`
- Problem 2 – `mirror_lake.py`
- Problem 3 – `blur.py`

## Environment
- Python 3.7
- IDE: PyCharm (recommended for running and debugging)

## How to Run
